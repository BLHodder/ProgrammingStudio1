Description
Global Climate Change Data from 1750-2013
Summary

Some say climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say it’s a myth based on dodgy science. We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view.

Note that the original data was based on daily average temperature observations. 
This has been greatly reduced by aggregating down to a yearly frequency. 
This was done by averaging the daily average temperature observations
In addition the minimum and maximum of the daily average temperature for each year was calculated.

In this dataset, we have include several files:

* Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalYearlyTemp.csv):

  Date: starts in 1750 for average/min/max land temperature and 1850 for average/max/min ocean and land temperatures
  AverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius (average of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  MinimumTemperature: global minimum land temperature in celsius (minimum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  MaximumTemperature: global maximum land temperature in celsius (maximum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)

  LandOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius (average of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  LandOceanMinimumTemperature: global minimum land and ocean temperature in celsius (minimum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  LandOceanMaximumTemperature: global maximum land and ocean temperature in celsius (maximum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)

* Other files include:

  Global Average Land Temperature by Country (GlobalYearlyLandTempByCountry.csv)
  Date: starts in 1750
  AverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius (average of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  MinimumTemperature: global minimum land temperature in celsius (minimum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  MaximumTemperature: global maximum land temperature in celsius (maximum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  Country: Name of country that the temperature was observed
  
  Global Average Land Temperature by State (GlobalYearlyLandTempByState.csv)
  Date: starts in 1750
  AverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius (average of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  MinimumTemperature: global minimum land temperature in celsius (minimum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  MaximumTemperature: global maximum land temperature in celsius (maximum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  State: Name of state where temperature was observed
  Country: Name of country that the state is located in  
  
  Global Land Temperatures By City (GlobalYearlyLandTempByCity.csv)
  Date: starts in 1750
  AverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius (average of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  MinimumTemperature: global minimum land temperature in celsius (minimum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  MaximumTemperature: global maximum land temperature in celsius (maximum of the daily average temperature for the entire year)
  City: Name of city where temperature was observed
  Country: Name of country that the city is located in
  Latitude: Latitude coordinates of city
  Longitude: Longitude coordinates of city
